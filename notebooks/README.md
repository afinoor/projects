# Building a prediction model for Bproperty.com
Bproperty is a property solutions provider, for both tenants and owners, in Bangladesh. They cater to the needs of those seeking real estate services offering a platform that enables anyone to buy, rent or sell properties in the country. After a owner has requested to put their real estate advertisement on Bproperty's website, Bproperty contacts the owner and sends a representative to scout the property. As a result no individual can put their property listing directly in the Bproperty's website and hence, the probability of fake listings are minimal. In this project, about 50 thousand rent listings in Bproperty.com from five cities of Bangldesh was extracted and analyzed. 

**The main objective** here is to build a model that will predict the rent of an apartment with maximum possible accuracy. 

This model can be used by the following parties:

1. **Bproperty.com:** This predictive model will be most beneficial for bproperty.com itself. If they feed the information of apartments that were successfully traded, they can easily predict the optimum rent for a listing depending on number of bedrooms, baths, features; and the city the apartment is situated in. Later, they can provide better consultations to the owners. Moreover same model can be deployed for other types of properties as well.
2. **Individual real estate owners:** Individuals owning an apartment and willing to rent it out to others, can benefit from this model, as, properties can be rented in a free       competitive marketplace only if it is rented at or less than the competitive market price. If the property is rented less than the market price then the owner will lose out on some money. On the other hand, if the asking rent is more than the market price then people will not pay for this property.
3. **Tenants:** Like the landlord, tenants can benefit from this model as well. Moreover, if an indidual wants to rent an house or flat in a particular location according to their personal need of number of bedroom and bathroom, and area of the house, they can easily predict the rent using this model.
4. **Real estate companies:** Real estate companies willing to undertake projects in a particular location can easily predict what the rent will be given their specification. This will help the companies evaluate the project before investing more accurately.
